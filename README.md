On this assignment it really pushed me to teach myself and do a ton of research on Javascript. I did get some help though from my tutor but she helped me a ton and I DEFINITLY learned a lot from the session. It definitly pushed me to think of coding in a new way and I have to say I'm proud of how to code turned out.
